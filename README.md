--------------
![build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/go9a25d0kyq6ir7i/branch/master?svg=true)

Renderer / game engine in Kotlin/Native with use of some native libraries.
Currently has only the OpenGL backend. Maybe it will support Vulkan
sometime in the future. 


## Building

### Automatically

Running the gradle tasks should be enough.
```
./gradlew buildNativeProjects generateInterops build
```

It will automaticaly compile all native projects and the the kotlin one.
This script is experimental but tested on [MSYS2 for Windows](https://github.com/orlp/dev-on-windows/wiki/Installing-GCC--&-MSYS2-). Building on other
platforms is not tested, however in theory should work.

You need to have working environment with: gcc, g++, cmake, bash, java (for Gradle).

This will take around 5 - 10 minutes.

### Manually

1. Build all native projects in `thirdparty` folder using cmake to `cmake-build-debug` directories.
2. Build the main Kotlin project with gradle by the `build` task. Get a coffee â˜•, this will take some time.
