kotlin-native-opengl
--------------
![build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/go9a25d0kyq6ir7i/branch/master?svg=true)
Renderer / game engine in Kotlin/Native with use of some native libraries
written currently only for OpenGL backend. Maybe it will support Vulkan
sometime in the future. 


## Building

### Automatically

You can run `build_all.sh` script to compile all third-party projects and then compile the
Kotlin one. This script is experimental but tested on [MSYS2 for Windows](https://github.com/orlp/dev-on-windows/wiki/Installing-GCC--&-MSYS2-). Building on other
platforms is not tested, however in theory should work.

You need to have working environment with: gcc, g++, make, cmake, sh, bash, java (for Gradle).

This will take around 5 - 6 minutes.

### Manually

1. Build all native projects in `thirdparty` folder using cmake to `cmake-build-debug` directories.
2. Build the main Kotlin project with gradle by the `build` task. Get a coffee â˜•, this will take some time.
